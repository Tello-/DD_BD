# DD_BD


 1) Clone Repo

 2) Open .sln in Visual Studio (windows)

 3) Set whichever project you'd like to launch as "startup project"
  
   This can be done in the solution explorer by right-clicking the desired project and click "set as startup"
 
 


4) Make sure that you are building in x86 and in debug mode.

I have included the entire SFML library in with the files. 
This is a relatively reasonable sized download but doing this allows me to share the solution with others in a simpler way.

Usually I'd look into making a CMAKE build file but in this case it's worth nobodies time.
